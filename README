1 Introduction
--------------

leo-lookup is a program to look up meanings of a word using the online 
dictionary called LEO. It is designed to be easy and extensible.

2 Using leo-lookup
------------------

One the major goals of leo-lookup is to provide an easy to understand interface.


To start leo-lookup just got through the following steps:

 1.  open a terminal window
     (using Gnome, this is done with [ALT]-[F2], type "gnome-terminal" 
      and a click on "Run")
 2.  change to the directory where the files of leo-lookup are stored 
 3.  run "leo-lookup.py" using "python ./leo-lookup.py"

Of course you can easy this process by creating a shortcut on the desktop, 
a panel or somewhere else
     	    working directory: "/.../leo-lookup/"
	    command: "python ./leo-lookup.py"
	    description: anything you want

Once you have started leo-lookup,
