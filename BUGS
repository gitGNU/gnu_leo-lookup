The following bugs are known to occur when using leo-lookup version 0.01:

- Parsing of response by http://dict.leo.org/ is of bad quality
  - By looking for a translation of "Haus", there are empty entries at the bottom of the results
    (This is caused by a missing </td> tag of the row in which "Beispiele" stands)
  - There is no output by looking up some words like admit, attain



If you encounter any bugs, not listed here, please contact one of the authors.
Thanks.
